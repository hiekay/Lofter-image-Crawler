# Lofter-image-Crawler
Author: Sparrow Purpose: downloading image from www.lofter.com in every blog's page once avoiding download image one by one. Created: 2016-7.4  This is supportted by Python 3.0. I can not guarrentee the stablist. So far, I only use this script in Mac OS 10.11.15. User, should type the URL whose lofter blog, can either copy the main blog's url, such as "http://yudengyue.lofter.com/", or copy any other child url, such as "http://yudengyue.lofter.com/post/1d877536_b942107". The image will download in the file named as "Lofterimgdownload" of the directory where you put this .py file in. You can modify the regular expression in the function of getImg() according to the html tag in different kind of pages to fit your needs. It is just a simple edition of crawler, which can be easily modify to crawler other website. I may give more specific crawler according to specific site such as baidutieba.
